# Learn-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas-Part-5
Python Project

Pandas is a super powerful, fast, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis tool.

This data set is actually quite famous and it's primarily used for training machine learning models and essentially training of machine learning models, especially natural language processing models is beyond the scope of this project. What we have here is different reviews from different customers on amazon Echo product and different ratings. The customers gave the product ratings range between one and five. Five star is good rating. However, if the customer gave one star, that means it's a very poor rating here.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ LOAD TEXT DATA AND PERFORM BASIC DATA EXPLORATION
- __Task 2:__ UPPER AND LOWER OPERATIONS
- __Task 3:__ FILTER OUT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RATINGS
- __Task 4:__ PERFORM PANDAS OPERATIONS PART 1
- __Task 5:__ PERFORM PANDAS OPERATIONS PART 2
- __Task 6:__ PERFORM TEXT DATA CLEANING BY REMOVING PUNCTUATIONS
- __Task 7:__ PERFORM TEXT DATA CLEANING BY REMOVING STOPWORDS
